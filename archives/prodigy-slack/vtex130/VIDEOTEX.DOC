1. INTRODUCTION

VIDEOTEX is a terminal emulator for the IBM PC, for use in accessing Videotex 
services  such  as  Bank of Scotland home and  office  banking  (HOBS).   The 
Videotex  screen  consists of 24 rows of 40 characters;  display  attributes, 
such  as  colour and graphics, are controlled by  embedded  characters  which 
occupy  space  on  the screen.  This format was  designed  to  suit  hardware 
implementation  and it is difficult to perform a full emulation in  software; 
this program is designed to provide a 100% emulation.

VIDEOTEX  requires an EGA, with at least 128K of RAM, or a VGA/SVGA.   It  is 
unusual in using the 512-character-font text mode of the EGA/VGA (rather than 
a graphics mode) to achieve the full range of display attributes; it is  this 
that  makes  it possible to perform a full emulation at a  reasonable  speed.  
All features of the Videotex display are supported: colour text and  graphics 
(contiguous and separated), background colour, flashing, double-height  (text 
and graphics), held-graphics (for abrupt colour changes) and concealed text.

The  full  Videotex (UK) character set is supported.   Those  characters  not 
having an equivalent in the ASCII set are obtained from the following keys:

     left arrow          [         long dash        _ (underscore)
     right arrow         ]         divide sign      ~ (tilde)
     up arrow            ^         double bar       |
     one half            \         small block      CTRL-2 or CTRL-backspace
     one quarter         {         pound sign       ` or œ
     three quarters      }

VIDEOTEX  is believed to be bug free... isn't all software!  If you  do  find 
any problems please TELL US using the methods given at the end of this file.


2. INSTALLATION

VIDEOTEX  consists  of the single executable file VIDEOTEX.EXE, it  needs  no 
installation.   The  only options are controlled by the REGISTER  program  or 
from the command line:

            VIDEOTEX [/b:baud] [/c:port] [/i:irqn] [dialstring][@scriptfile]

/b:baud     Controls the speed to which the serial port will be set.   'baud' 
            may  be  one of the following values: 75, 150,  300,  600,  1200, 
            2400, 4800, 9600, 19200 or 38400.  For example, /b:2400 sets  the 
            transmit  and receive speeds to 2400 baud.  If the /b  switch  is 
            omitted the speed defaults to 9600 baud.

/c:port     Determines which serial port (COM1 - COM4) is used.  For example, 
            /c:2 selects port COM2.  If omitted the port defaults to COM1.

/i:irqn     Determines  which serial port interrupt is used (IRQ3  -  IRQ15).  
            For  example,  /i:5  selects  IRQ5.   If  omitted  the  interrupt 
            defaults to IRQ4 for COM1 and IRQ3 for COM2.

dialstring  An  optional character string which will be processed  as  though 
            typed at the keyboard.  Note that the string may not contain  the 
            characters  /, <, >, @ or |.  If any of these are needed,  use  a 
            script file containing the required string.

@scriptfile Processes  the contents of the specified file as though typed  at 
            the keyboard; when the end-of-file is reached, the keyboard  will 
            be  activated as usual.  Control codes are ignored, so  the  file 
            may be split into separate lines to aid readability.

The  tilde character (~) can be used in the dial string and script  files  to 
allow  control characters and terminal commands to be incorporated.   Control 
characters  are  generated  by ~ followed by an UPPER CASE  letter:  e.g.  ~M 
represents the carriage return character.  Terminal commands are  represented 
by  ~ followed by a lower case letter: i.e. ~a to ~z correspond to  ALT-A  to 
ALT-Z  respectively.  Other codes which may be used are  ~? to send  the  DEL 
character  (7F) and ~~ to send the ~ character itself.  In script files,  but 
not in the dial string, ~0 to ~9, ~*, ~- and ~+ signify the user-defined keys 
(see ALT-K).  More details of the script language are given later.

You  can create batch files to access your favourite Videotex  services;  the 
MAKEBAT  utility  has been provided to simplify producing  such  files.   For 
example, the file HOBS.BAT might contain the following line:

         VIDEOTEX /b:19200 ~m~oAT&B1&H1&M4DT0345626611~M~i4444444444


3. OPERATION

When  the unregistered version of VIDEOTEX is executed an initial  banner  is 
displayed for five seconds or until a key is pressed (the registered  version 
does  not display this banner).  VIDEOTEX initialises to the  Offline  state: 
press ALT-O to go online.  The bottom row is a permanent status line.

All  the alphanumeric keys generate the normal codes (see above  for  special 
characters).   Control  codes  are sent conventionally:  for  example  CTRL-L 
(clear screen) or CTRL-^ (home cursor) may be sent to an online editor.   ESC 
and RETURN generate the standard codes.

The  'arrow'  keys generate the appropriate cursor-movement codes  and  other 
special keys are pre-programmed with appropriate character sequences:

                    Home      *0#       (go to index page)
                    End       *90#      (leave)
                    PgUp      *#        (recall previous page)
                    PgDn      #         (enter / next page)

                    Backspace           (delete previous character)
                    Tab                 (tabulate)
                    SHIFT-Tab           (back-tab)

                    Ins       ESC i     (insert character)
                    Del       ESC d     (delete character)
                    CTRL <-   ESC b     (word left)
                    CTRL ->   ESC f     (word right)
                    CTRL Home ESC K     (edit start)
                    CTRL End  ESC J     (edit end)

Function keys:

The  function keys, in conjunction with SHIFT and CTRL, can be used  to  send 
attribute  codes to line (or direct to the screen if in Offline mode).   Some 
response frames do not allow all these codes to be used.

               normal              with SHIFT          with CTRL

     F1        alpha red           graphics red        separated graphics
     F2        alpha green         graphics green      contiguous graphics
     F3        alpha yellow        graphics yellow     hold graphics
     F4        alpha blue          graphics blue       release graphics
     F5        alpha magenta       graphics magenta
     F6        alpha cyan          graphics cyan
     F7        alpha white         graphics white
     F8        flash               steady
     F9        new background      black background
    F10        double height       normal height       conceal


The carousel:

A carousel of previously-viewed frames is kept in memory; if the memory fills 
the  oldest frame in the carousel is overwritten.  When the current frame  is 
cleared  from the screen (by receipt of the CTRL-L code) it is first  written 
to  the  carousel; note that if the frame is cleared by another  method  (for 
example  recalling  another  frame from disk) then it is not  stored  in  the 
carousel.

The  contents  of the carousel may be reviewed, when in  offline  mode,  (see 
section 5) or may be saved to disk (ALT-F).  There is no command to clear the 
carousel, but this may be achieved by loading the carousel from the NUL  file 
(ALT-G command).


Mailbox editing:

Mailbox messages can be prepared off-line to save time and telephone charges.  
To  do  this  you should first save to disk the empty  mailbox  frame  (ALT-S  
command);  this need only be done once.  When offline you can then load  this 
frame  (ALT-L), add/edit your message and save the completed frame  to  disk.  
Take  care to enter your text only within the area provided for the  message, 
and  avoid use of the # character.  Several different frames may be  prepared 
this way, each saved to disk with a different filename.

When next online, go to the page containing the blank mailbox frame which you 
previously saved.  When this frame is displayed, with the cursor at the first 
location  of the message area, recall the filled-in frame from disk  (ALT-L).  
Transmit  the  frame  using the ALT-T command, if all is  well  your  message 
should  be transferred to the remote host; if necessary use *00 to check  it.  
The usual prompts should then be followed to send the message.

If the message is corrupted, for example because of line noise, then  re-load 
the  frame from disk and try again.  Some response frames initially move  the 
cursor by two spaces, which can cause the transmitted frame to be shifted; if 
this is a problem press right-arrow then left-arrow before issuing the ALT-T.

Script language:

A simple script language is provided to allow automation of some  operations, 
such  as  logging onto HOBS, downloading a number of frames and  logging  off 
again.   The  script  language  has only three commands,  each  of  which  is 
introduced by the ~ (tilde) character:

          ~{        Start a block
          ~}        End a block
          ~|<expr>  Exit from a block if <expr> is true

The  contents  of a script file between a start-block code and  an  end-block 
code are repeated indefinitely.  In other words, on encountering an end-block 
code  a  'jump' to the matching start-block code is made.  The  only  way  to 
leave a block (other than with CTRL-BREAK) is with the exit-block code;  this 
is followed by a conditional expression which can evaluate to TRUE or  FALSE.  
If  FALSE, execution continues after the exit-block command; if TRUE, a  jump 
is made to the end-block code and execution continues after this.  Blocks may 
be  nested to a depth of nine levels.  An exit-block code not within a  block 
will cause termination of the script file if the condition is TRUE.

The  only  conditional  tests currently provided are for the  presence  of  a 
specified  string on the screen or the existence of a specified file  in  the 
current directory:

      ~|"Hello"        exits the block if "Hello" is displayed on the screen
      ~|#"Filename"    exits the block if the file "Filename" exists 

The  sense  of  a test may be reversed by prefixing  the  expression  with  ! 
(signifying NOT), for example:

      ~|!"Hello"

will  exit  the block if the string "Hello" is NOT displayed.  Tests  may  be 
combined with the logical | (OR) and & (AND) operators, but in this case  the 
entire expression must be enclosed in parentheses, for example:

      ~|("Hello"&"there")

will  exit  the  block if both "Hello" and "there"  are  displayed.   The  OR 
operator may be used to cope with uncertainties about spelling etc., e.g.:

      ~|("Hello"|"hello"|"HELLO")

A  null string ("") is always TRUE so this can be used for  an  unconditional 
jump.  For example, comments may be included using the following syntax:

      ~{~|"" The unconditional exit causes this comment to be skipped ~}

REPEAT...UNTIL,  WHILE...DO and IF...THEN constructs can be  fabricated  from 
the primitive commands as follows:

      ~{<operation>~|<condition>~}       REPEAT <operation> UNTIL <condition>

      ~{~|!<condition><operation>~}      WHILE <condition> DO <operation>

      ~{~|!<condition><operation>~|""~}  IF <condition> THEN <operation>

4. TERMINAL FUNCTIONS
                    
ALT-A   Awaits a receive timeout.  For use in script files (~a).

ALT-B   Sends a 'break', of approximately 0.2 seconds, to the serial output.

ALT-C   Show  codes:  disables  the action of all  attribute  characters  and 
        instead displays them as special two-letter symbols, as follows (note 
        that the split-screen mode, if selected, is cancelled):

               NU   NUL *               DL   DLE *
               AR   alpha red           GR   graphics red
               AG   alpha green         GG   graphics green
               AY   alpha yellow        GY   graphics yellow
               AB   alpha blue          GB   graphics blue
               AM   alpha magenta       GM   graphics magenta
               AC   alpha cyan          GC   graphics cyan
               AW   alpha white         GW   graphics white
               FL   flash               CD   conceal display
               ST   steady              CG   contiguous graphics
               EB   end box *           SG   separated graphics
               SB   start box *         EC   ESC *
               NH   normal height       BB   black background
               DH   double height       NB   new background
               SO   shift out *         HG   hold graphics
               SI   shift in *          RG   release graphics

        *  these symbols correspond to undefined escape sequences and  should 
        not  normally  be seen.  They relate to the  stored  attribute  codes 
        rather than the characters received; e.g. NUL results from ESC @. 

        The  status  line  is replaced by a list of these  symbols,  in  code 
        order, as an 'aide memoire'.  In this mode, any characters which were 
        received with a parity error (odd parity rather than even parity) are 
        displayed on a red background.  Press any key to exit this mode.

ALT-D   Dumps  the  currently  displayed frame as a  colour  graphics  bitmap 
        (.BMP)  file. You are prompted for a filename; press RETURN  when  it 
        has been entered; to abort the operation press ESC.

ALT-E   Erases  a  file from the disk.  You are prompted  for  the  filename: 
        wildcards are not allowed.  To abort the operation press ESC.

ALT-F   Files  (saves) the carousel.  You are prompted for a filename;  press 
        RETURN when it has been entered.  To abort the operation press ESC.

ALT-G   Gets (loads) a saved carousel. You are prompted for a filename; press 
        RETURN when it has been entered.  To abort the operation press ESC.

ALT-H   Calls up a 'help' page.  Press any key to return to normal.

ALT-I   Waits  until receipt of the ENQ character, or a local  keypress  (for 
        use in script files).  May be aborted with CTRL-BREAK.

ALT-J   As ALT-T but transmits the rest of the frame (not just up to the next 
        # character) and converts trailing spaces to CR LF sequences, even if 
        the cursor is not in the 'home' location (top left-hand corner).

ALT-K   Programs a user-defined key.  The key combinations ALT-0 to ALT-9 and 
        keypad *-+ can be programmed to produce character sequences.  You are 
        prompted for the key to define (0-9, *, -, +) and for the string  you 
        wish  to  place in the key: press RETURN to enter  the  string.   The 
        total length of all the user-defined strings is limited to 240 bytes.  
        The  tilde (~) character may be used to introduce  terminal  commands 
        and control characters as per script files, except that ~{, ~| and ~} 
        signify the PgUp, Home and PgDn keys respectively.  The keys can also 
        be permanently pre-programmed using the REGISTER utility.

ALT-L   Loads  the  screen from a file.  You are prompted for  the  filename; 
        press RETURN when it has been entered.  To abort the load press ESC.

ALT-M   Move screen contents to right-hand side (or enter split-screen mode).

ALT-N   Pulses the DTR line for approximately 0.2 seconds and issues the ATH0 
        command, which will cause most modems to hang-up the telephone line.

ALT-O   Toggles between online (remote) and offline (local) operation.   When 
        offline  the status line shows the message 'Offline'  and  everything 
        entered  at the keyboard is sent to the local display rather than  to 
        line.  Characters received whilst offline will still be displayed.

ALT-P   Prints  the  currently displayed frame.  Requires an Epson  FX80,  HP 
        Laserjet  or Canon compatible printer (configured using the  REGISTER 
        utility)  connected to the LPT1 port, which may be re-directed  using 
        the DOS MODE command.  To abort the print press CTRL-BREAK;  however, 
        if the printer is switched off the program may not respond.

ALT-Q   Quits  from  the program, and sets the RTS line  inactive.   You  are 
        prompted for confirmation; any keypress other than Y aborts the exit.

ALT-R   Reveals any concealed text. This key has a toggle action: pressing it 
        again  conceals  the  text.   Receipt of  a  clear  screen  character 
        establishes the 'concealed' state.

ALT-S   Saves the displayed frame to a file. You are prompted for a filename; 
        press RETURN when it has been entered.  To abort the save press ESC.

ALT-T   Transmits the currently displayed frame to line.  This operation  has 
        two  modes, depending on the initial cursor position.  If the  cursor 
        is in the 'home' location (top left corner of the screen) the  entire 
        frame  is  sent,  with  trailing spaces  being  converted  to  CR  LF 
        sequences.  If the cursor is not in the 'home' location, the  portion 
        of the frame from the cursor position to the next # character (or  to 
        the  end  of the frame if there are no # characters)  will  be  sent; 
        trailing spaces are not converted to CR LFs.  See also ALT-J.

ALT-U   Uploads  a file as if typed at the keyboard; ~ sequences  within  the 
        file will be processed as for a script file.  You are prompted for  a 
        filename, press ESC to abort.

ALT-V   Views  the  disk directory.  All files in the current  directory  are 
        listed;  if the screen fills the program waits for a keypress  before 
        scrolling the display.  Press any key to return to normal.

ALT-W   Pauses  for  one second.  This is primarily intended for  use  within 
        script files (~w) and is not generally very useful from the keyboard.

ALT-Y   Changes  the current disk drive or directory.  If a drive name  alone 
        is  entered (e.g. A:) the default drive is changed.  If  a  directory 
        path is entered, the current directory is changed.

ALT-Z   Telesoftware  download.   Should  be entered  when  the  telesoftware 
        'header' frame is displayed, to initiate transfer of CET-encoded data 
        to  a  disk file on your machine.  You are prompted for  a  filename, 
        which defaults to that given in the 'header'; press RETURN to  accept 
        that filename, or enter another.  To abort the command press ESC;  to 
        abort the download once started press CTRL-BREAK (this may result  in 
        an incomplete file being left on your disk).


5. OFFLINE EDITING

When  the terminal is offline, frames may be edited locally.  A frame can  be 
loaded from disk with the ALT-L command, edited, then saved back to disk with 
the ALT-S command.  The following keys are active in this mode:

left arrow   Moves the cursor left one character.

right arrow  Moves the cursor right one character.

down arrow   Moves the cursor down one line.

up arrow     Moves the cursor up one line.

Tab          Moves the cursor right to the next 8-character-wide column.

SHIFT-Tab    Moves the cursor left to the previous 8-character-wide column.

CTRL <-      Moves the cursor left until it is at the start of a word.

CTRL ->      Moves the cursor right until it is after the end of a word.

RETURN       Moves the cursor to the start of the line.

Backspace    Deletes the character to the left of the cursor.

Ins          Inserts  a space at the cursor position.  All  characters  after 
             the cursor are moved right.  The last character is lost.

Del          Deletes the character at the cursor position.

CTRL PgDn    Inserts  a blank line at the cursor position.  All  lines  below 
             the cursor are moved down.  The bottom line is lost.

CTRL PgUp    Deletes the line containing the cursor.

Home         Moves to and recalls the first frame in the carousel.

End          Moves to and recalls the last frame in the carousel.

PgUp         Moves back one frame in the carousel.

PgDn         Moves forward one frame in the carousel.

CTRL L       Writes the frame to the carousel, then clears the screen.

CTRL ^       Moves the cursor to the top-left (home) position.

CTRL Q       Turns on the cursor.

CTRL T       Turns off the cursor.

CTRL W       Toggles  the  top-left graphics 'sixel' at  the  current  cursor 
             position, assuming the graphics mode is active.

CTRL E       As CTRL W, but toggles the top-right 'sixel'.

CTRL S       As CTRL W, but toggles the centre-left 'sixel'.

CTRL D       As CTRL W, but toggles the centre-right 'sixel'.

CTRL X       As CTRL W, but toggles the bottom-left 'sixel'.

CTRL C       As CTRL W, but toggles the bottom-right 'sixel'.

ESC o        Turns off the colour/word wrapping mode.

ESC w        Turns on the colour/word wrapping mode.


6. ERROR MESSAGES

If  an  error  occurs a flashing message will appear in  the  centre  of  the 
screen;  press any key to clear this message.  The possible messages  are  as 
follows:

Access denied      A file could not be created or opened (e.g. an attempt  to 
                   create a new file with the same name as a read-only file).

Bad directory      The specified disk drive/directory does not exist.

Device fault       A device fault occurred, e.g. while printing a frame.

Disk fault         The disk is faulty, e.g. unformatted or not inserted.

Disk full          The  output  file cannot be written because  the  disk  is 
                   full.

Disk read only     The  file  cannot be written, because the disk  is  write-
                   protected.

Download fault     An  irrecoverable download error occurred, e.g.  incorrect 
                   number of frames or maximum retries exceeded.

File not found     An attempt was made to read a file which does not exist.

File system error  A miscellaneous filing system (i.e. disk) error occurred.

Handshake?         The  receive  buffer has overflowed, owing to  failure  of 
                   hardware  (RTS) and/or XON-XOFF handshaking.   Handshaking 
                   should only be required at very high data rates.

Invalid header     The Download command was issued but no valid  telesoftware 
                   header  frame is displayed.  If necessary, re-display  the 
                   frame with *00.

Nested too deep    Blocks in a script file are nested more than nine deep.

RX overrun         An incoming data byte was lost.  This can be caused by the 
                   KEYB  utility  which disables interrupts for  an  extended 
                   period.   A replacement KEYB routine is available  if  you 
                   find this to be a problem.

RX parity          A  parity error was detected on the incoming serial  data.  
                   As checking is disabled, this error should not occur.

Script syntax      A script file command cannot be understood.

TX timeout         A  character  could  not be sent  to  the  serial  output.  
                   Probably  caused by the CTS handshaking line being low  or 
                   disconnected.  Check the wiring of your modem connection.

User abort         The user has pressed CTRL-BREAK to abort an operation.
