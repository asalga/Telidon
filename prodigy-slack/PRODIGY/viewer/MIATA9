¡ÈÀÀÉ¾ÀÈ£Ä³ÀÁÃÚÿü¡ÈÀÀÀ¾Ä£À²ÀÁŞÚşÎ¾Ü¢ğÀÀÁî¸ÀÈÈÛñø¤ÂÎÉ  Last week you got a Miata,
and you can't stop thinking
about it. The purr of the
engine. The rush
of the wind. This
morning you put
its picture on
your desk, right
next to the picture of your
family. Remember the look on
the kids' faces when you 
brought it home?¸ĞÈÀËùÀ¤ÒÎÁ  Noon. Time for lunch. "I've
got to run some errands,"
you tell your secretary. But¸ĞğàËÉà¤Òğçshe knows better.
You're going for
a spin. You can't
wait to get behind
the wheel. Every¸ĞÈÀËùÀ¤ÑÈÁtime you drive the Miata, it
feels like the first time.²ÉÒÀÉØğ¾Ä¤ÓÀÂ©ÇÂÂ¤ÑÁÄ©ÇÀÅ¾ğ¸¤ĞÚÀAttention to detail...[NEXT]¡ÈÀÀÉ¾ø£Ğ³ÉÓÍÀöÙ¡ÈÀÀÒ£À¤É×ú©ÀØÀ¡ÈÀÀÉ£Ğ³ÑËİÀæÉ¾Ü·ÑçÿøøÔøğèøğëÇÆÆÇÇşÀÈÒ·ÊØÉÀÈÔÇÇÿÀÀûÇÏÇÀÀòÇÇïÇÆÄøğûÿÿÖøğÚÿÿÇøğú¡ÈÀÀÀ¾À·ÊàÒÀÀÌÀÀâÇÇßÇÇÖÇÇÌÿÿôÿÿşÇÇÎÇÏÖÇÇÍÇÇìÇÇÓÿÿôÿÿìÿÿşøøèÇÇÁøèâÀÀÆøøúøùøøøóøøéøøóÀÀÌÀÀÔÀÀÙÇÇßÿÿõÀÀòÀÀÉøøò¡ÈÀÀÉ¾ø·Éô×ÀÀÅÇÇŞÿÿó¡ÈÀÀÀ¾È£À·ÑÂÂøøíÀğÀÇÇÃ¡ÈÀÀÉ¾À¤Ñïå©ÿöÀ·ÑŞÚÀÀàÇÇÂÇÇìøğĞÀÀì¤ÑŞê©ÀÀÁ¾Ğ¯ÑÊêÀÈüÇÏì¡ÈÀÀÀ¾À£Ğ¤ÒÉï©ÇÁÆ¤ÒÁß©ÇÁÆ¾È¤ÑŞø©ÇÇÄÇÇİ¾ğ¤ÑÂú©ÀÀë¾À¤ÑÂò©ÀÀë¡ÈÀÀÉ£À¤É×ú©ÇÏçÀÈé¤Éôâ©ÇÇÆ¦ÉôÏ¡ÈÀÀÀ¾È¤Éóä©ÿşş¤Éäİ©ÇÇæÇÇï¤ÉıÌ©ÇÇ×¥
