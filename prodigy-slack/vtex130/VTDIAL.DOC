This is a very simple 'shell' for Richard Russell's excellent VIDEOTEX.EXE 
Viewdata terminal comms program.  It is for all those who prefer a dialling 
directory to separate .BAT files for different services and options.

VTDIAL will allow you to have up to 20 different entries in its dialling 
directory, each one fully configurable so that they can be used for different 
accounts, different services, different access nodes, use different scripts 
or whatever suits you.

It calls VIDEOTEX with a suitable command line for the service and/or 
options you've specified.  When you exit VIDEOTEX you are back to the VTDIAL 
dialling directory.

VTDIAL.COM can be renamed to any valid MS-DOS executable file name and will 
create and look for a dialling directory file with the same name and an 
extension of .PHN.

When you first run the program it will start off in 'create entry' mode to 
create your .PHN directory file.  It asks you a series of questions very 
similar to MAKEBAT.COM that comes with VIDEOTEX but with one or two extras 
thrown in.  It offers a default for each entry, you can accept the default 
by just hitting return, over type the default (the 1st character you type 
other than just hitting Enter discards the default) or clear the field and 
leave it blank by just hitting Backspace.

VTDIAL asks if you want the Num Lock ON during VIDEOTEX.  If you have a new 
style 101/102 key keyboard and normally have the NumLock set OFF but want it 
on during VIDEOTEX then VTDIAL can set it on (whatever its initial state) 
before it calls VIDEOTEX and restore it to its original state upon return.

The main VTDIAL screen is the dialling directory displaying all the services 
you have set up.

To enter a new service hit the Insert key and answer the questions.  NOTE: 
After the first service is set up the parameters for the first service become 
the defaults offered for subsequent services.

To edit an existing service to change some of the settings hit Home and 
select the entry to edit.  NOTE: You can actually select the entry 3 ways: 
i)   hit Home and then confirm by hitting Enter
ii)  hit Home and select the entry by moving the highlight using the cursor 
     keys and using Enter to select
iii) hit Home and then type the letter for the service.

To delete an entry from the dialling directory hit the Delete key and select 
the entry using the same 3 methods as used to select an entry to edit above.
