**TelidonP5.js** allows NAPLPS vector graphics files to be displayed in a browser using p5.js.<br>
Its companion decoder library **naplps-decoder.js** can also be used independently.<br>

2018 is the 40th anniversary of the NAPLPS format, created in 1978 for use on Telidon computer systems. The Telidon hardware was discontinued in 1985, but the graphics format remained in wide use throughout the BBS era, until the early 1990s. Thanks to its exceptionally small file size, and limited animation features, it can be seen as a technological ancestor of the animated GIF and the Flash SWF&mdash;one of the first media both produced and consumed on a computer. 

From 1982&ndash;1985, members of the Toronto arts org <a href="http://interaccess.org/">InterAccess</a> used Telidon systems to produce an ambitious series of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezveak/the-original-net-artists">interactive video pieces</a> in the format, and three anniversary events are being held there in spring 2018:<br>
