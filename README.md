**<a href="https://github.com/n1ckfg/Telidon/blob/master/js/TelidonP5.js">TelidonP5.js</a>** allows NAPLPS vector graphics files to be displayed in a browser using p5.js.<br>
Its companion decoder library **<a href="https://github.com/n1ckfg/Telidon/blob/master/js/naplps-decoder.js">naplps-decoder.js</a>** can also be used independently.<br>

August 15th, 2018 is the 40th anniversary of the NAPLPS format, created in 1978 for use on Telidon computer systems. The Telidon hardware was discontinued in 1985, but the graphics format thrived and remained in wide use throughout the BBS era, until the early 1990s. Thanks to its exceptionally small file size and limited animation features, it can be seen as a technological ancestor of the animated GIF and the Flash SWF&mdash;a medium that allowed new types of work to be both produced and consumed on the same machine. 

From 1982&ndash;1985, members of the Toronto arts org <a href="http://interaccess.org/">InterAccess</a> used Telidon systems to produce an ambitious series of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezveak/the-original-net-artists">interactive BBS-based artworks</a> in the format.

Three anniversary events are being held at InterAccess in spring 2018:<br>
