2018 is the 40th anniversary of the NAPLPS vector graphics format. It was<br>
originally created for display on Telidon hardware systems. The first use of the<br>
system by artists was at <a href="http://interaccess.org/">InterAccess</a> in<br>
Toronto. The format was popular during the BBS era&mdash;tiny file sizes and<br>
limited animation features made it a sort of precursor to the animated GIF.<br>
