Some archival strategies we've found so far, ranked from simple to complex:

1. NAPLPS images are readable in CorelDraw, including current CorelDraw 2017; you can then save to a modern format like SVG. Original fonts are not preserved, but you can approximate them with a TTF equivalent. 

2. Turshow 6 can be run in DOSBox to more faithfully present NAPLPS images, displaying the original fonts and using the progressive draw-on effect. Turshow does not export, but DOSBox can used with a screen capture utility.

3. For displaying original interactive works beyond individual images, John Durno at UVic has developed a complete BBS emulator setup for Ubuntu Linux.
