SHOWPLP Program (Version 2.05)
Copyright (C) 1991 Microstar Software Ltd.
 
This software works with a BBS FOSSIL to show Presentation Layer Protocol
(PLP) frames on a caller's terminal.  This includes built-in support for
ISO registered standard sequences for switching the terminal between the
graphical NAPLPS syntax and a textual ASCII syntax.  To run this program
the SYSOP composes on the command line a script of commands to control a
standard reception terminal display mode, to display a file, to wait for
user keystrokes, etc.  The default mode of operation of the program is to
output and input data to and from a pre-loaded FOSSIL driver.
 
The syntax for the command line is as follows:
 
      SHOWPLP  { /option { /option ... } }  command  { command ... }
 
The following options are available:
 
 /B{ios}         - ignore fossil driver return codes; use BIOS INT 14H
 /D{ebug}        - debug; all output to screen and input from the
                   keyboard (default is all output and input to
                   and from BBS fossil driver)
 /H{elp}         - display this information on local console
 /P#             - port number # for fossil driver (default 1)
 /ST             - suppress titles in browse function
 
The syntax for the command arguments is as follows:
 
 @<filespec>     - execute single lines from automatic response file (ARF)
                 - see the discussion below regarding ARF files
 B<dirspec>      - browse a directory of files interactively
 C<comment>      - command is a comment (no action)
 F<filespec>     - send the given file
 Hxxyyzzaabb...  - send hexadecimal sequence out (nibble pairs)
 I               - interrupt file send on any character (default)
 Ixx             - interrupt file send on hexadecimal character
 IN              - no interrupt of file display
 K               - wait for any key
 Kxx             - wait only for hexadecimal key
 PA              - send sequence to flush sender's and receiver's
                   buffers and switch display to ASCII presentation
 PN              - send sequence to flush sender's and receiver's
                   buffers and switch display to NAPLPS presentation
 Tnnn            - set timeout in seconds (default = 300 (5 minutes),
                   maximum = 3600 (one hour)) for user inactivity (actual
                   timeout approximate due to fossil timeout restrictions)
                 - a timeout value of 0 indicates inhibit timeout
                 - at timeout, display switched to ASCII and program exits
                 - see the discussion below regarding timeout
 
Automatic response files are ASCII edited text files containing any number
of lines, processed in order as if they were arguments on the command
line.  ARF files are handy when the script of commands is longer than the
available space for a command string.  The ARF file is limited to having
one command argument per line.  Following the command, an optional comment
can follow a semi-colon ';' character for documentation purposes.  An ARF
file may have any valid DOS name.
 
Errors processing a command are displayed through stdmsg to the BBS
screen without any error message displayed to the remote caller.  The
DOS Exit Codes are: 0 == normal, 1 == help, 2 == bad fossil init
                    3 == lost DCD, 4 == inactivity timeout
 
Examples:
 
  SHOWPLP Pn Ffile K Pa         - show NAPLPS file; break on any key
  SHOWPLP Pn I0d Ffile K0d Pa   - show file; break on CR only
  SHOWPLP Pn In Ffile K0d Pa    - show file; no break; continue with CR
  SHOWPLP T0 Pn In Ffile1 Ffile2 Ffile3 K Pa - show many files (no timeout)
  SHOWPLP /P2 @\files\script    - follow a set of commands in an ARF file
  SHOWPLP Pn Bdirfiles Pa       - browse a directory of NAPLPS files and
                                  change to ASCII when completed
  SHOWPLP /P*P Pn Ftitle K Bdirbrw Pa - set port to *P argument, change
                                        to NAPLPS, show title page, wait
                                        for any key, browse directory,
                                        change to ASCII
  SHOWPLP "C*F *L" Pn Ffile K Pa - display comment before displaying file
 
  Note that some bulletin board doorways require explicit path and extension
  to be specified for the executing program, for example:
 
    c:\ra\showplp.exe /P*P Pn Fd:\file\gallery\picture K Pa
 
  The Microstar technical support bulletin board at (613)727-5272 contains
  a number of NAPLPS Galleries that use this program through a doorway.
 
Browse Directory Function:
 
 When browsing a directory of files, SHOWPLP will order files in the order
 they appear in an unsorted directory list.  After a file is displayed or
 interrupted, the name of the file and it's sequence number is shown for
 the user's reference.  To browse the next file in the directory, press
 space, carriage return, 'N' for next or 'F' for forward.  To browse the
 previous file in the directory, press 'P' for previous or 'B' for back.
 To repeat the file currently being displayed, press 'R' for redisplay.
 When finished browsing press 'Q' for quit or the 'Esc' key.  Digits
 followed by a return will jump to the sequence number.  Digits followed
 by next file or previous file commands will jump forward or back by the
 number of frames.  Clear sequences are sent before frames if the
 presentation is NAPLPS.
 
Timeout Feature and NAPLPS Files with WAIT Constructs:
 
 There is a 300 second (5 minute) default timeout specification if no
 'T' argument is on the command line.  The timeout restarts whenever the
 program receives a character from the remote system or transmits a
 character to the remote system.  For those NAPLPS files with multiple
 WAIT constructs, it is possible for SHOWPLP to finish sending the file
 long before the reception software finishes displaying the complete image.
 In some cases, the timeout may trigger before the display is completed,
 requiring the specification of a longer timeout period.
 
An Important Technical Note regarding FOSSIL Flow Control:
 
 There are FOSSILs that do not handle XOFF/XON handshaking correctly.
 This can be tested by the SYSOP while connected remotely by repeatedly
 pressing CTRL-S and CTRL-Q during a menu or other long text display.  The
 CTRL-S will halt the display and the CTRL-Q will resume the display.  If
 characters are lost, then the FOSSIL driver may have difficulty sending
 long NAPLPS files to terminals that handshake frequently.  A single byte
 lost in a NAPLPS syntax stream can destroy the visual effect of an image.
 
An Important Technical Note regarding Modem Flow Control:
 
 Some modems default to operate with XON/XOFF control between the two
 modems.  If this is engaged, this will interfere with the receiver
 software signalling the BBS software to halt transmission during, for
 example, a long NAPLPS file.  The end result of this interference will
 be lost data and corrupted NAPLPS images or long text files.  It is
 imperative that the modems allow the flow control to pass between the
 two pieces of software without interference.  Note also that the control
 character DC4 (0x14) is a signal to some communication packages to flush
 their input buffers.
